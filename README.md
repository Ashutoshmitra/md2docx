- `--input`: Path to input Markdown file or directory
- `--output`: (Optional) Path to output Word file or directory
- `--template`: (Optional) Path to Word template file (.dotx)

## Creating Compatible Markdown

To ensure the best conversion results, follow these guidelines when creating Markdown content:

1. Use standard Markdown syntax for headings (`#`, `##`, etc.)
2. Use consistent list markers (preferably `-` for unordered lists)
3. Use proper indentation for nested lists (2 spaces per level)
4. Leave a blank line before and after lists, code blocks, and headings
5. For more detailed guidelines, refer to the included LLM prompt template

## LLM Prompt Template

For generating AI content that works seamlessly with this converter, use the included prompt template. This ensures that the Markdown follows the conventions expected by the converter.

The prompt template is available in the application directory as `llm_prompt_template.md`.

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Application doesn't start**
   - Ensure you have Python 3.6+ installed
   - Try running the application from Terminal using `./launch_converter.sh`

2. **Conversion fails**
   - Check that your Markdown file is valid
   - Ensure the template file exists and is a valid .dotx file
   - Check file permissions for the output directory

3. **Styling issues in output document**
   - Ensure your template contains the styles referenced in the Markdown
   - Check that the Markdown follows the conventions in the LLM prompt template
