# Sustainable Gardening Guide

## Introduction

This guide provides practical advice for creating and maintaining an environmentally friendly garden. Sustainable gardening practices conserve resources, support wildlife, and produce healthy plants.

## Core Principles

* Work with nature, not against it
* Conserve water and energy
* Minimize waste
* Support biodiversity
* Build healthy soil

## Planning Your Garden

### Site Assessment

Before planting, assess the following:

* Sunlight exposure throughout the day
* Soil type and quality
* Drainage patterns
* Existing vegetation
* Climate zone

### Plant Selection

Choose plants based on:

* Native species that support local wildlife
* Adaptability to your climate conditions
* Water requirements matching your region
* Disease resistance
* Growth habit appropriate for the space

### Garden Layout

Design your garden with these considerations:

1. Group plants with similar needs
2. Plan for mature plant sizes
3. Create layers of vegetation
4. Include habitat features for wildlife
5. Consider seasonal interest

## Soil Management

Healthy soil is the foundation of a sustainable garden:

* **Composting**: Convert kitchen scraps and yard waste into nutrient-rich soil
* **Mulching**: Apply organic mulch to conserve moisture and suppress weeds
* **Minimal Tillage**: Limit soil disturbance to protect soil structure
* **Cover Crops**: Plant during off-seasons to prevent erosion and add nutrients

### Simple Compost Recipe

```
Compost Ingredients:
- 2 parts brown materials (dry leaves, cardboard, woody prunings)
- 1 part green materials (food scraps, coffee grounds, fresh grass clippings)
- Water to maintain moisture (like a wrung-out sponge)
- Air (turn pile every 2-4 weeks)
```

## Water Conservation

Efficient watering practices:

| Method | Best For | Water Savings |
| ------ | -------- | ------------- |
| Drip Irrigation | Vegetables, shrubs | 30-50% |
| Soaker Hoses | Flower beds, borders | 20-30% |
| Rain Barrels | Supplemental watering | Varies |
| Mulching | All plantings | 10-30% |
| Rain Gardens | Managing runoff | Site-specific |

### Watering Tips

* Water deeply but infrequently to encourage deep roots
* Water early morning to reduce evaporation
* Direct water to the soil, not leaves
* Use rain sensors or smart controllers
* Collect and use rainwater when possible

## Pest Management

Sustainable approaches to pest control:

1. Prevention
   * Choose resistant varieties
   * Maintain plant health
   * Practice crop rotation
   * Use physical barriers

2. Monitoring
   * Inspect plants regularly
   * Identify pests correctly
   * Determine damage thresholds
   * Track weather conditions

3. Intervention
   * Start with least harmful methods
     * Handpicking
     * Water sprays
     * Traps
   * Use biological controls
     * Beneficial insects
     * Microbial products
   * Apply organic products only when necessary
     * Insecticidal soaps
     * Neem oil
     * Botanical extracts

## Seasonal Maintenance Calendar

### Spring Tasks

* Test soil and amend as needed
* Start compost for the season
* Divide perennials
* Apply compost to beds
* Set up rain barrels

### Summer Tasks

* Mulch to conserve moisture
* Harvest rainwater
* Monitor for pests and diseases
* Deadhead spent flowers
* Collect seeds for saving

### Fall Tasks

* Collect leaves for compost
* Plant cover crops
* Divide and transplant
* Protect sensitive plants
* Clean and store tools

### Winter Tasks

* Plan next season's garden
* Order seeds
* Maintain tools
* Monitor winter protection
* Start seeds indoors (late winter)

## Recommended Tools

* Digging fork
* Hand pruners
* Stirrup hoe
* Watering can
* Rain gauge
